Till that time, the Prime Minister\u2019s Office had not returned the cypher copy to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he said.\nEarlier, Azam Khan, the former principal secretary of the ex-PM had also told the court that the copy of the cypher had been misplaced by Imran.\nRead more:\u00a0'Missing cipher' stokes legal troubles for Imran\nIn his testimony given in the court on January 18, Azam Khan had claimed that Imran Khan directed his military secretary and personal staff \"a number of times\" to search for the cypher, but then he waved a piece of paper in the public rally on March 27 \"implying\" that it was the diplomatic cypher.\nReferring to the incident, the former bureaucrat had, however, clarified that \"as he [Imran Khan] did not open or read it [in the rally], therefore, I do not know what the paper was.\"\nDuring the testimony of Sohail Mahmood, when Prosecutor Rizwan Abbasi intervened, Shah Mahmood Qureshi objected, saying that the written statement is already in front of him, and the witness knows what to state.\nHe expressed respect for the former foreign secretary, calling him an honorable person.

He requested Qureshi not to behave in such a manner.\nQureshi stated, \"If the prosecutor interrupts the witness, then I will definitely speak. I will not remain silent.\" His lawyer, Ali Bukhari, requested the court to get the witness\u2019s statement recorded himself.\nThe judge, addressing Shah Mahmood Qureshi once again, said, \"Shah Sahib, this doesn't look good. If the proceedings are going in a better way, let them continue.\"\nThe PTI leader replied that if the former prime minister and former foreign minister have confidence in the former foreign secretary, then the prosecution should also not intervene.\nDuring the conversation between the judge and Qureshi, the PTI founder, Imran Khan, also came to the rostrum and said, \"Here, there is only an attempt to save [US official] Donald Lu.\"\nThe court, in response to Qureshi's objection, prevented Prosecutor Rizwan Abbasi from intervening during the testimony of the witness. After concluding the statements of the four witnesses, further proceedings in the case were adjourned till Tuesday (today).\n"}, {"title": "Half a million Afghans return from Pakistan: IOM", "url": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2454073/half-a-million-afghans-return-from-pakistan-iom", "date": "January 22, 2024", "article_text": "\n\nKABUL:\n\nMore than 500,000 Afghans have left Pakistan in the four months since Islamabad ordered undocumented migrants to leave or face arrest, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said on Monday.\nAccording to the latest figures reported by the UN migration agency, 500,200 Afghans left Pakistan between September 15, 2023 and January 13, 2024.\nMost rushed to the border in the days leading up to a November 1 exit deadline Islamabad set for the 1.7 million Afghans it said were living illegally in Pakistan, and as police opened dozens of holding centres.\n\"Since the initial peak around November 1, the number of individuals crossing these official border points have consistently decreased but remains higher than pre-September 15th,\" an IOM statement said.\nPakistan defended the crackdown by pointing to security concerns in its regions bordering Afghanistan and pressure on its struggling economy.\nRead also:\u00a0Pak-Afghan trade at Torkham border stops over visa dispute\n\"Some Afghans forced to return may be at risk of persecution, arbitrary arrest and detention and/or torture or ill-treatment,\" the UN's Afghan mission said in a report on Monday.\nMeanwhile, the busiest border crossing between the two countries remained closed for the tenth day running in a dispute over document rules for commercial drivers.\nThe row centres on demands for drivers from both sides to have visas and passports -- documents many Afghans do not have -- as Pakistan cracks down on cross-border movements.\nMore than 400 trucks were stranded on the Pakistan side of the Torkham crossing on Monday, according to a border official who asked not to be named.\nUpon arrival, migrants have received modest assistance from the government and NGOs in a country contending with one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world.\n"}, {"title": "Contesting to 'bury old politics of hate': Bilawal", "url": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2454072/contesting-to-bury-old-politics-of-hate-bilawal", "date": "January 22, 2024", "article_text": "\n\nSAHIWAL:\n\nPPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Monday reiterated his rallying cry of \u201cburying the old politics\u201d and ushering in a new era to address the challenges faced by the people, asserting that only his party was able to do that.\nSpeaking at an election rally in Sahiwal, Bilawal, who is cruising through Punjab on a campaign trail, lashed out at other parties for engaging in divisive politics, accusing them of promoting hatred and animosity.\nHe warned that if these parties were to come into power, they would likely victimise their political opponents. \u201cI am contesting to bury the politics of hate and division,\u201d he asserted.\n\u201cOther parties want to divide us, whereas we are contesting elections on our manifesto \u2026 we will not use foul language against our political opponents,\u201d the PPP chief added.\nRead more:\u00a0Bilawal says Imran should not be in jail if innocent\nBilawal further reiterated that his party aimed to introduce a new era of politics centered around serving the people, asserting that the PPP would transform the nation's destiny within a single term without the need for four terms in government to fulfil their promises and reshape the fate of both the nation and the country.\n\n\n\u067e\u0627\u06a9\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u06cc\u067e\u0644\u0632\u067e\u0627\u0631\u0679\u06cc \u06a9\u06d2 \u062a\u062d\u062a \u0636\u0644\u0639 \u0633\u0627\u06c1\u06cc\u0648\u0627\u0644 \u06a9\u06d2 \u06c1\u0627\u06a9\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u0679\u06cc\u0688\u06cc\u0645 \u0645\u06cc\u06ba \u06c1\u0648\u0646\u06d2 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u06d2 \u062c\u0644\u0633\u06c1 \u0639\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u06cc\u06ba \u0639\u0648\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0648\u0631 \u06a9\u0627\u0631\u06a9\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0634\u0631\u06cc\u06a9 \u06c1\u06cc\u06ba@BBhuttoZardari #\u0686\u0646\u0648_\u0646\u0626\u06cc_\u0633\u0648\u0686_\u06a9\u0648 pic.twitter.com/gyH3F8HnOX\n\u2014 PPP (@MediaCellPPP) January 22, 2024\n\n\n\"We should embrace a new form of politics, whose primary objective is to serve the people, farmers, labourers, youth, and the marginalised masses of the country.

He said Israel would keep insisting on full security control over all territory west of the Jordan River, which would include Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\nBorrell spoke at the monthly gathering of EU foreign ministers, attended this time by counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan and the Arab League secretary-general. The talks will focus mainly on the consequences of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel and Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza.\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz and Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki were making separate appearances at the meeting, which was also taking stock of the war in Ukraine.\nAlluding to Israel's stated objective of annihilating Hamas in its devastating three-month-old war in the Gaza Strip, Borrell told reporters: \"What are the other solutions they have in mind. Make all the Palestinians leave? Kill all of them?...The way they are destroying Hamas is not the way to do it. They are sealing the hate for generations.\"\nBorrell said he wanted to press ahead with international efforts to create a process that would lead to a Palestinian state co-existing alongside Israel. The last talks to that end collapsed a decade ago amid mutual mistrust and intransigence.\nIsrael's massive aerial and ground offensive in small, densely populated Gaza has killed more than 25,000 Palestinians, according to Hamas-run enclave's health authorities, flattened built-up areas and left most of its 2.3 million people homeless.\nIsrael has said the war could go on for \"many months\" and it would not rest until Hamas was eradicated, all Israeli hostages freed and the Gaza Strip posed no more security threat.\nRead also:\u00a0EU's Borrell says Israel financed creation of Gaza rulers Hamas\n\"We have engaged in over 30 years of process and look where that has got us,\" Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi told reporters, referring to intermittent Israeli-Palestinian peace talks since the 1990s.\n\"A moment of truth is upon us. Do we allow a radical racist agenda to dictate the future or come together and say the path is clear, we want peace for everybody and a two-state solution is the only path, go ahead and implement it?\"\nIn brief remarks to reporters, Israeli foreign minister Katz said he was in Brussels to discuss the issue of hostages held by Hamas and to reaffirm that Israel would dismantle Hamas and restore its national security. He took no questions.\nAhead of the Brussels meeting, the EU's diplomatic service sent a discussion paper to its 27 member countries, suggesting a roadmap to peace in the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nAt the heart of the plan is a call for a \"preparatory peace conference\" to be organised by the EU, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the League of Arab States, with the United States and United Nations also invited to be conveners of the gathering.\nThe conference would go ahead even if Israelis or Palestinians declined to take part. But both parties would be consulted at every step of the talks as delegates sought to draw up a peace plan, the document suggests.\nThe internal document, seen by multiple news organisations including Reuters, makes clear one key goal of a peace plan should be the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, \"living side by side with Israel in peace and security\".\nRead:\u00a0Saudis could recognise Israel if Palestinian issue resolved: FM\nEU officials concede that Israeli officials and diplomats currently evince no interest in the so-called two-state solution but insist it is the only option for long-term peace.\nThe Palestinian side is deeply split over the approach, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority that exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank having negotiated with Israel, while the PA's arch-rival Hamas is sworn to Israel's destruction.\nNetanyahu's office said on Saturday after a phone call with US President Joe Biden that Israel must retain security control over Gaza \"to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty\".\nThe EU paper also suggests the peace conference participants should spell out \"consequences\" for both sides, depending on whether they accept or reject a plan approved by the gathering.\nIt does not say what these consequences might be, although the EU has some areas of potential leverage.\nThe bloc is a major provider of economic aid to Palestinians and has a broad cooperation agreement with Israel that includes a free-trade area. Some officials have privately suggested the latter arrangement could be used to influence Israel.\n\"All those who say they don't want to hear about such a solution have not brought (up) any alternative,\" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said.\n"}, {"title": "Nawaz promises development in K-P if voted in", "url": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2454058/nawaz-promises-development-in-k-p-if-voted-in", "date": "January 22, 2024", "article_text": "\nPakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif promised a slew of development projects in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) on Monday if his party is voted in on February 8.\nAddressing a public gathering in Mansehra, the three-time former premier blamed the province's citizens for voting the PTI in.

However, similar to the case with previous elections, the General Elections 2024 too have raised anticipation among the citizens, who despise imagining the state\nof their beloved city after the elections are over, when no political party would display a grain of willingness to remove the promotional material, which badly defaces public property.\n\u201cIt is the responsibility of all political parties to remove the promotional material which destroys the beauty of Karachi\u201d said a female citizen, who further beseeched the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to take to task all parties which failed to clean up their campaigning mess after the elections.\"\nConcurring with the local, Muhammad Nasir Khan, a social leader, also felt that once the elections were over, no political party paid any attention to the removal of the publicity material. \u201cThese advertising materials remain displayed in public places for several weeks and months, after which they collapse and fall on the road, leading to accidents,\u201d observed Khan, who also opined that eventually such a large number of posters and banners could end up obstructing drainage lines.\nKhan\u2019s concerns were validated by manufacturers of publicity material like Syed Zubair Ahmed, who confirmed that this time around political parties and independent candidates were investing in massive flags, handbills, leaflets, portraits and banners.\nRead:\u00a0Removal of political banners from bridges, hoardings ordered\n\u201cThe nine by three feet cloth banner is the most popular choice among parties at the moment. The rate of each banner varies between Rs700 to Rs900 and most of these are being sold across Liaquatabad, Al-Karam Square, Pakistan Chowk and Korangi,\u201d revealed Hamza, another manufacturer of banners.\nAccording to Naveed Saeed, also a publisher of campaigning material, almost all political parties and independent candidates are preparing nine by six inch handbills. \u201cThese handbills and pamphlets carry the introduction and manifesto of the candidates. They are being distributed across mosques and other public places,\u201d said Saeed, who further added that 1,000 pamphlets and handbills cost a maximum of Rs2,500.\nSimilarly, Faizan, a flag maker, said, \u201cEach two by three feet flag is being produced for Rs300 to Rs500.\u201d\nOn the other hand, Iftikhar Ahmed, a printer of polling cards, claimed that even though campaigning was still big on the parties\u2019 agenda, the usage of polling cards had decreased. \u201cEach polling card is printed for Rs3 to Rs5,\u201d he added. Ahmed\u2019s evaluation was supported by Muhammad Zohaib, a member of various election campaign events, who noted\u00a0an overall shift in the campaigning strategies of political parties in Karachi. \u201cOrganizing big rallies is not a priority this time around.\nMost parties are now preparing social media portraits to run their election campaigns online. This portrait contains photographs, election symbols, brief introductions and manifestos of their candidates for the national and provincial assemblies,\u201d shared Zohaib, who added that each portrait cost between Rs300 to Rs500.\nOn a similar note, Kashif Khan, who is associated with campaigning for the General Elections in Karachi, cited rising inflation as another factor which has altered the campaigning drives. \u201cThe prices\nof materials used during the promotional campaigns have increased by 180 to 200 per cent. Therefore, this time around political parties and independent candidates are not campaigning in the same way as\nthey did during the 2008, 2013 and 2018 General Elections,\u201d said Kashif. Sharing their insights on the matter, Syed Aminul Haq and Waqar Mehdi, the respective representatives of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and the Pakistan People\u2019s Party (PPP) concurred that rising inflation had\nraised the expenditures on campaigning this time around.\n\u201cThis time we are running a full-fledged public contact campaign in Karachi, in accordance with the ECP\u2019s Code of Conduct,\u201d maintained Hafiz Naeemur-Rehman, candidate of the Jamaat-e-Islami Karachi. Speaking to the Express Tribune on the matter, Syed Nadeem Haider, ECP\u2019s cen-\ntral spokesman said, \u201cAll publicity material will be monitored by our teams.

Their primary concern, she stressed, revolved around having food on their table and ensuring fundamental rights.\u201cPeople are looking for change now.\u201d\nHer previous stint helped her to come up with different tactics including campaign songs to convince people, she said.\nNayab revealed that she deliberately chose 'green chilli' as her electoral symbol because it's the most basic household item that used to come free with groceries. However, due to inflation caused by the incumbent and previous rulers, it is no longer provided without cost.\nResponding to the question of why she was contesting from two constituencies, Nayab explained that she has been actively involved in the community for several years.

If the situation in Palestine remains unattended, it can potentially spread conflict in other regions by non-state actors who can leverage global networks to spread the anti-human armed conflict in the rest of areas where violence may erupt so quickly to endanger peace. Moreover, continuous war in Gaza will further upset the power dynamics in the Middle East where US influence is declining due to its unconditional support to Israel.\nThe hopes for peace and regional security are diminishing because the issues of Kashmir and Palestine have remained unresolved despite the UN resolutions. Israel has continuously dishonoured the commitments ensured under Balfour Declaration and UN resolutions by disallowing Palestinians to form the viable state. India too does not abide by UN resolutions and refuses to accept the right to self-determination of Kashmiris and rejects any possibility of mediation by a neutral party. The UN Security Council has remained ineffective on deciding the matter by holding a plebiscite under its auspices. Both issues are ethnic, territorial, historical and ideological in nature. India is applying new techniques of warfare and lawfare to bring a demographic change by altering constitutional position of Kashmir. Israel is also pushing natives to leave their land by isolating Hamas. Thus, both US strategic partners \u2013 Israel and India \u2013 are engaged in campaigning against their target populations using similar strategies stemming from their strong nexus which seems unchallenged by ruling-elites of Muslim world who are loyal to West instead of being able to demonstrate commitment to their own people by taking tangible actions to muzzle Indo, Israeli leadership. The forced occupation of Israel in Palestine and Indian atrocities in Kashmir are being conducted consistently through brutal killing of thousands of people including children and a range of war crimes including torture, inhuman handling of prisoners of war, captured detainees and displacement of prisoners without their consent in sheer violation of international humanitarian law. These barbaric crimes are systematically organised in both Palestine and Kashmir as a serious breach of international humanitarian law. Further attacks on civilians and medical aid workers and volunteers during armed conflict are examples of blatant criminality against humanity.\nIsrael has been violating the international law by monstrously attacking hospitals, monuments and religious and cultural heritage sites of Palestine since the Hamas reaction of October 7, 2023. Both India and Israel have used explosive weapons prohibited under international law. In Kashmir, India has been involved in extra-judicial killings, custodial tortures, arbitrary detentions, violence against civilians and enforced disappearance of people causing distress to their families. Indian security forces have also used pellet guns, causing injuries and blindness to innocent civilian populations. Further, putting serious restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly of Kashmiris and prolonged curfews, lockdowns enforced by Indians forces are wrongful acts of violating international law.\nThe prosecution of war crimes can occur in International Criminal Court (ICC) which must take up these violations and protect the human rights codified in the Geneva Conventions. Palestine has acceded to the Rome Statute and the ICC has jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute the individuals involved in war crimes against humanity. There are several laws which protect the human dignity against the plight of humans in war and peace. For instance, convention on prevention of genocide was adopted by the UN in 1948 as punishable crime. In 1965, the UN also adopted the ICERD convention to combat all forms of racial discrimination and promote racial equality. In 1984, Convention Against Torture (CAT) was adopted to prohibit torture and cruel treatment of humans. During the year 2002, protocol was made to develop a mechanism for preventing torture and inhuman acts. For protection of all persons from enforced disappearances, an international convention was adopted in 2006 to prevent punishable crime of enforced disappearances in various forms including arrest, detention and abduction of individuals by state or with its consent. The UN Security Council resolution No 1674(2006) can also be used as an effective law against the crimes of genocide, torture and violence. Kashmir and Palestine are under situations of occupation; thus, International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and International Human Rights Law (IHRL) are applicable to deal with different situations of extra-judicial executions under IHRL as a crime under Article 7 of the Rome Statute and willful killings under IHL as a serious violation of Fourth Geneva Convention and it is codified as war crime by the Rome Statute of International Criminal Court (ICC).\nHowever, the performance of the global institutions in implementing IHL and IHRL is hampered by big power chauvinism. The big powers are involved in global decision-making which shape the world order. Nevertheless, they are reluctant to deter aggression and are unwilling to mediate brutal conflicts if their geopolitical, military and diplomatic interests are not served. They control global politics by taking military actions, selling arms, triggering financial crisis and destabilising regions to create their own networks of influence by forming alliances and counter-alliances. This has led to erosion of UN authority and credibility.\nThe UN Security Council can impose economic and diplomatic sanctions on belligerent states which endanger peace and violate international law. Further, it has power to authorise the use of force against the aggressive parties in the escalated armed conflict in Gaza. However, unilateral and undemocratic approach of casting veto on the Palestine situation has paralysed the Security Council and possibility of peace has received a serious setback. The international community must take efforts to democratise the Security Council and ensure implementation of Article 6 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which recognises that \u201cevery human being has the right to life\u201d.\n\u00a0\nPublished in The Express Tribune, January 22nd, 2024.\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n"}, {"title": "Some reflections on the life and work of Sartaj Aziz", "url": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2453985/some-reflections-on-the-life-and-work-of-sartaj-aziz", "date": "January 22, 2024", "article_text": "\nWhen my wife and I called on Satrtaj Aziz in March 2023, he had then celebrated his 94th birthday. He was in remarkably good health. That was the first time I visited him at the spacious house he had built near Islamabad, in the backs of the hills overlooking the Pakistani capital. He took us to the back of the house which had a large grass-covered lawn where, he said, he practised putting. He was still playing golf.\nI write this tribute to Sartaj who died on January 2, 2024 as he was approaching his 95th birthday. This is not an obituary \u2013 plenty of those have appeared \u2013 but an assessment of the role he could have played in today\u2019s fractured political system and an economy that is on the verge of collapse. During his long public life, he was able to build bridges over the many political divides that are now obstructing the development of the country\u2019s political system. He was able to work comfortably with the people with whom he disagreed. Having worked in important positions in foreign institutions, he was also highly regarded by foreigners who had a deep interest in Pakistan\u2019s well-being.\nThis short piece will take the readers over some of my dealings with Satrtaj during the time we worked closely with one another. In Pakistan\u2019s often-troubled history, a person of Sartaj\u2019s caliber, dynamism, patriotism and strong desire for doing good for the nation could play an important role in making the country work again.\nSartaj was active in the student movement that campaigned for the creation of an independent state for the Muslim population of British India. His large office on the premises of the Lahore-based Beaconhouse National University, the BNU, had his picture with Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah prominently displayed on one of the walls. He was then the Vice Chancellor of the BNU.\nMy association with Sartaj goes back to the mid-sixties when he worked at the Planning Commission and I was deputy secretary in charge of managing foreign aid in West Pakistan, then one of the country\u2019s two provinces. He was one of the leading thinkers in the Commission; the other two were Mahbubul Haq and Moeen Baqai. At this point I need to step back a bit and refer the conversation I had with Muhammad Ayub Khan, the former military president of Pakistan. That was in the winter of 1974, a few months before Ayub Kahn died of a massive heart attack. I had then begun work on a book on Pakistan\u2019s economy which was published in 1980 by London\u2019s Macmillan Press. I told him of the book I had begun to work on. \u201cWould it cover my period?\u201d he asked. I said that I treated his 11 years in office, from 1958 to 1969, as the country\u2019s golden period. \u201cZulfi doesn\u2019t think so,\u201d he said, referring to the statements Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was making after resigning from the Ayubian cabinet in which he had worked first as Commerce Minister and then as Foreign Minister.\nI then went on to ask the question which was to be the central piece of the conversation with the former president. He had read the books by some of the American economists who had written after spending years working in the Federal Planning Commission and in the two Provincial Planning and Development Departments. The most notable of these accounts is Gustaf F Papanek\u2019s Pakistan\u2019s Development: Social Goals and Private Incentives published in 1967 by Harvard University Press. The book advocated that other countries in the developing world should follow the approach Pakistan had adopted under Ayub Khan. \u201cReflecting your own experience in taking Pakistan forward, what would you regard as your most important contribution?\u201d I asked the former president. His answer surprised me.\n\u201cNo matter what Zulfi says, I was not a dictator,\u201d he responded. \u201cI sought and eagerly followed the advice I received from experts on policy issues and on the financing of large public sector projects. That is the reason why I built the Planning Commission. When I took charge of the country, the Commission had only two economists of any consequence: Mahbubul Haq and Sartaj Aziz. It was clear to me that they needed good deal of support so when the American president sent over a team to ask me what they could do for Pakistan, I asked for economists to be sent to work in the Commissions and the Panning Departments in the two provinces.\u201d This led to several years of association with Pakistan of Harvard University\u2019s Development Advisory Service, the DAS. Papanek was a member of this team.\nI recalled this conversation with Sartaj during a visit to Pakistan in 2008. He took me out for lunch to a restaurant in Lahore and said what Ayub Khan had said to me was totally true. Said Aziz: \u201cThe DAS team was enormously helpful to us in the Commission. However, when Bhutto became the head of the government, he had no interest in talking to experts. He operated by his gut feelings; he had no use for advice.\u201d The Planning Commission continued to exist but had little say on policy matters and was not consulted about the pros or cons of investing large amounts of public resources on projects. When we had that conversation, Sartaj was of the view that there was no political interest in reviving the type of Planning Commission to replicate the one that existed during the Ayub Khan period. Instead, he thought, we should set up a body in the private sector. He asked me to draw up the plans for such a body for which he will find funding from the budget from the BNU coffers.\nThus was born the Institute of Public Policy, the IPP. However, when Sartaj Aziz resigned from the BNU and went to Islamabad to take up a position in the government that came into office when Nawaz Sharif won the election and became the prime minister, the BNU withdrew its support from the IPP. At that point the Burki family stepped in with financing to keep the institution operating and the IPP became the Burki Institute of Public Policy or BIPP.\n\u00a0\nPublished in The Express Tribune, January 22nd, 2024.\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n"}, {"title": "The 4-1 drubbing", "url": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2453983/the-4-1-drubbing", "date": null, "article_text": "\nMercifully, it\u2019s over.

It is high time for robust security measures and comprehensive risk management training to fortify these endeavours. Yet, the battle extends beyond security measures. The silent war on health heroes necessitates a societal paradigm shift, urging communities to actively debunk myths surrounding vaccinations.

The initial source of the news was Iranian state media, though it later deleted the post. I was skeptical that the news was true. Why? Because the day Iran breached Pakistan\u2019s air space, the Iranian Foreign Minister met the Pakistani Prime Minister on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos; and two days prior, an aide of the Iranian President was in Islamabad; and a day earlier Pakistan and Iranian navies had conducted joint drills in the Strait of hormuz. I texted a senior Pakistani official, who deals with the region, about the speculations. I was expecting the official would resolutely rebut the news. But he confirmed the Iranian strikes. An hour later, the Foreign Office issued a statement, confirming Iran violated Pakistan\u2019s airspace. There were claims and counter-claims. Iran claimed it struck two terrorist hideouts in Pangour district of Balochistan. The target, according to Iran, was Jaish al-Adl, a militant outfit operating from Iran\u2019s Sistan-Baluchestan province. But Pakistan contested the claims. It said strikes killed two innocent children and injured 3 girls.\nPakistan and Iran may have had security issues along the border but a very few in Pakistan were expecting Iran to resort to such a unilateral action. The background discussions with relevant officials suggested that Islamabad thought Tehran might come with an explanation and offer an apology. Had Iran done that, Pakistan would not have resorted to counter-attack. But when Iran did not respond as per the expectations, Islamabad in a first step decided to recall its envoy from Tehran and asked the Iranian ambassador to stay back who was already in his country. The move was taken in the hope that Tehran would realise its \u2018mistake\u2019 and get the message that Pakistan had not taken this transgression lightly. But the Iranian government was unmoved. Instead, Iranian officials started boasting about its strikes inside Pakistan. That was when Pakistan decided to hit back.\nIt was clear from the readout of the Foreign Office that while Pakistan did conduct retaliatory strikes it had no intention to escalate the situation further. The ball was in Iran\u2019s court. By the time Pakistan retaliated, certain international players got involved to defuse the tension. China, Russia and on top of it Turkey worked overtly and covertly to prevent further escalation. Iran too realised that there was no point in escalating the matter. Soon the two countries established contacts to lower the tensions. Foreign Ministers of the two countries spoke by phone and agreed to restore the diplomatic ties.\nThe dramatic turn of events in 24 hours may serve as a template for other countries on how to defuse tensions. The two countries pulled back from the brink merely within 24 hours. The question is: what did Iran gain out of those strikes? Prior to such strikes, Iran certainly enjoyed great goodwill among the Pakistanis. Many Pakistanis appreciated Iran\u2019s clear stance on Israel at a time when other Muslim countries have taken a more nuanced position. Pakistan has always tried to maintain a delicate balance in its ties with Iran and the west and Arab countries. Islamabad in the past resisted pressure from those countries to act against Tehran.\nBy launching missile strikes, Iran sent a wrong message to Pakistan. On the contrary, Pakistan has much to gain from this crisis. It has once again established that even if a friendly country ties to breach its sovereignty, it will be given a befitting response. It has sent a message to other neighbours too, particularly India, that if it is thinking of any misadventure ahead of the general elections then it is mistaken. Also, the handling of the crisis has helped the security establishment restore its public image in the wake of its tussle with a political party. No matter what was the ultimate objective of Iran, the reality is that its misadventure proved a blessing in disguise for Pakistan!\n\u00a0\nPublished in The Express Tribune, January 22nd, 2024.\nLike Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.\n"}, {"title": "Are paper ballots still necessary today?", "url": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2453979/are-paper-ballots-still-necessary-today", "date": "January 22, 2024", "article_text": "\n\nISLAMABAD:\n\nAll is set to print ballot papers for the 2024 election in Pakistan, and the three public sector printing press facilities \u2013 Security Printing Corporation, the Pakistan Postal Foundation, and the Printing Corporation of Pakistan \u2013 are dedicated to catering to the voluminous job in the shortest period of time.\nThe Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) sanctioned the printing of 250 million watermarked ballot papers for the upcoming general elections during its meeting held in Islamabad. It is estimated that a total of 2,070 tonnes of paper will be used to print 250 million ballot papers.\nOne tonne of paper is produced using the wood from 24 mature trees; therefore, 2,070 tonnes of paper will consume 49,600 trees, which may lead to an increased rate of deforestation.\nThe world has transitioned from traditional paper-based communication to paperless practices in business, as digitisation not only preserves trees but also reduces expenses on paper, printers, ink, postage, office space, and the time employees spend managing paperwork. This shift towards a paperless system has the potential to save significant national resources for countries embracing digitisation.\nIn Pakistan, the challenges of digitising the public sector are evident, and efforts are underway through initiatives like e-government. This aims to transition paper-based official communication and file management to a digital protocol, especially in cold mountainous areas, with a focus on enhancing efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\nHowever, the process has been slow, spanning over a decade and initially implemented on a trial basis in selected ministries.\nForests face intense pressure in Pakistan due to a significantly low forested area compared to other South Asian and Asian countries. The predominant use of fuelwood for domestic energy, utilised by over 90% of the rural population, exacerbates the issue.\nRead\u00a0Ballots to have distinct watermarks\nPer capita fuelwood consumption stands at 0.72 m3 in cold mountainous areas and 0.52 m3 in plain regions annually. Consequently, a household with ten members consumes 72 m3 in colder mountain areas and 52 m3 in plain areas, equating to the felling of 6-10 trees per family each year.\nThis highlights an ongoing challenge, where afforestation rates consistently lag behind deforestation rates in Pakistan.\nThe task of cutting trees to produce 2,070 tonnes of paper for the 2024 election will result in the depletion of 49,600 trees, intensifying the strain on Pakistan\u2019s diminishing forestry resources. To address this challenge, it is crucial to explore alternatives to paper for elections, aiming to conserve trees and alleviate pressure on existing forest reserves.\nForests serve as Earth\u2019s life support system, providing essential ecosystem goods and services necessary for sustaining life on the planet. Their pivotal roles include oxygen production, carbon sequestration, habitat provision for biodiversity, regulation of water cycle, and mitigation of climate change impacts. The estimated annual contribution of a standing tree to nature is valued at $3,600.\nThis calculation factors in the cost of oxygen production and the value of carbon sequestration; showcasing the tree\u2019s significance beyond its timber or firewood potential.\nThe shift to paperless practices, driven by state-of-the-art technologies, eliminates the need to cut forests for paper and pulp processing. Traditional paper production, coupled with its distribution and transportation, often relies on carbon-emitting fossil fuels.\nMoreover, decomposing paper releases carbon dioxide or methane, potent greenhouse gases. Embracing a paperless approach mitigates these emissions, offering cost savings for businesses.\nResearch indicates that the most significant savings in going paperless come from reduced time spent searching for or recreating lost documents, averaging 86 hours per employee annually.\nAdopting paperless systems can alleviate the environmental impact of the paper industry, where 42% of logged trees are used for pulp and paper production. A global shift away from paper could cut deforestation rates by almost half.\nRead\u00a0 ECP fixes Jan 22 as last date for postal ballot\nPakistan\u2019s substantial import expenditure on paper and pulp could be curtailed by implementing paperless systems in businesses, offices, and society. The younger generation, accustomed to digital communication and business practices, holds the key to preserving forests through widespread adoption of paperless approaches.\nBeyond environmental benefits, paperless systems reduce storage costs by minimising physical space requirements, transforming office layouts from file-centric to more efficient workspaces with desks and other functional areas.\nAcknowledging the benefits of a paperless system, businesses remain cautious due to certain drawbacks such as security risks and viruses. Elections, similarly, face vulnerabilities, with digital rigging posing a threat to the integrity of results.\nDespite these challenges, the global community employs various IT security protocols to protect banking and financial systems, continually developing advanced security and anti-hacking software.\nPakistan needs to enhance its capabilities, create new software, and leverage existing tools to secure its digital systems for the current and future generations.\nWhile both paper and paperless systems have their pros and cons, the prominent advantage of the paperless approach lies in saving trees and achieving efficiency, time, and space reductions compared to traditional paper-based systems.\nPakistan should capitalise on the benefits of a paperless system and implement measures to safeguard against potential hacking and rigging threats.\nTHE WRITER IS A PhD IN FOREST MANAGEMENT AND A CLIMATE CHANGE AND NATURAL RESOURCES PROFESSIONAL\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPublished in The Express Tribune, January 22nd, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"}, {"title": "Pollution risks by petrol pumps", "url": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2453978/pollution-risks-by-petrol-pumps", "date": "January 22, 2024", "article_text": "\n\nISLAMABAD:\n\nWe pass through a smog season every winter which impairs social and economic life in our major cities, especially in Punjab. Schools are closed and the children and the elderly fall sick.\nWe have, in the recent past, described the source of problems and the solutions thereof in a number of pieces. In this space, we will discuss the pollution and health impact of petrol pumps and the need for introducing controls in this respect.\nPetrol pumps sell gasoline, diesel and a variety of petroleum products like lubricants. Petrol pumps are usually responsible for a considerable emission of gasoline vapours, which are toxic and carcinogenic.\nVarying amounts of gasoline vapours are emitted from cars\u2019 fuel tanks during the filling of gasoline. Also gasoline vapours are emitted during the filling of underground storage tanks when being filled by gasoline bowsers and make their way through a vent shaft, which is usually provided in storage tanks.\nGasoline vapours contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which affect human health and cause ozone pollution. NOx and VOCs can undergo a number of chemical reactions with sunlight, heat, ammonia, moisture, and other compounds to form the noxious vapours, ground-level ozone and particles that comprise smog.\nIt should be noted that the ground-level ozone is dangerous and toxic while sky-level ozone has a positive function, which blocks ingress of violet rays into the human atmosphere. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which are used in sprays, have been banned because CFCs break the protective ozone layer.\nAutomotive exhausts also emit NOx, CO2 and VOCs due to incomplete combustion. Thus, both automotives and petrol pumps\u2019 vapour emissions are responsible for the creation of ozone and smog.\nVapour emissions from petrol pumps have been underestimated and often ignored. It has been shown by studies that vapour emissions from petrol pumps are indeed significant and can extend to a distance of more than 300 feet from the petrol pumps.\nRead\u00a0 Air pollution haunts twin cities\u2019 dwellers\u00a0\nHowever, earlier studies had lower estimates, which have given rise to liberal location laws for the petrol pumps. In the meantime, technology has developed on-board vapour recovery systems, which are beyond the scope of Pakistan and this paper.\nIn order to control vapour emissions from petrol pumps, two types of gasoline vapour recovery systems (VRS) are provided in the regulatory laws of industrialised countries.\nStage 2 System deals with vapour recovery from car tanks, which is sucked by the filler itself through an annular pipe and a pump.\nStage 1 deals with vapour recovery from storage tanks, which used to be vented hitherto in most industrialised jurisdictions, but it is no more the case. It continues to be the case in developing countries. The vapours recovered are recycled.\nAll petrol pumps are not required to install vapour recovery systems. Smaller low-sales petrol pumps are exempted from the installation of vapour recovery systems.\nIt also depends on the location and population density of the area. In some locations, in the US, petrol pumps having sales of more than 600,000-840,000 gallons per year are required to install the system.\nWhile most industrialised countries have regulations requiring the installation of vapour recovery systems in petrol pumps exceeding sales beyond a certain volume, developing countries are lagging behind.\nRecently, India has issued vapour recovery regulations. In large cities, large petrol pumps have installed such systems. But the numbers are not high.\nRead\u00a0\u00a0Soaring pollution in Lahore fills wards with sick children\nPetitions have been filed by activists in environmental tribunals against oil companies. Indian government has now become stricter and has issued deadlines in this respect.\nIndian rules require a sales limit beyond 100 KL per month in locations having a population of one million or more for the installation of vapour recovery system. The threshold limit is 300 KL and a population of 100,000 to 1 million.\nThere are 10,000 petrol pumps in Pakistan, of which reportedly many are unlicensed and illegal ones. Petrol pumps located on high traffic flow roads in large cities may be required to install such systems.\nVolume of sales has to be a criterion as well. A study should be conducted to collect vapour emission densities at petrol pumps and appropriate regulations and rules be developed.\nOne should also study the cost of the system and its possible impact on petrol prices.\nReportedly, Pakistan State Oil (PSO) has started working on a pilot study in this respect. Others should also be encouraged to do such studies. Environmental agencies should also be involved in impact studies.\nIf found feasible, the vapour recovery system may help reduce pollution and smog in the critical and sensitive areas in Pakistan.\nThe minimum that can be done is to use the cover associated with the gasoline filling gun, which covers the car tank inlet, for stopping the release of vapours outside. Often, one finds such a cover missing, which pollutes the whereabouts, affects workers and even customers.\nPetrol pump workers can be worst affected. Their regular medical check-up should be introduced as well.\nThe writer is former member energy, Planning Commission and an author of several books on the energy sector\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPublished in The Express Tribune, January 22nd, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"}, {"title": "Transmission sector reforms and load-shedding", "url": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2453977/transmission-sector-reforms-and-load-shedding", "date": "January 22, 2024", "article_text": "\n\nLAHORE:\n\nElectricity load-shedding is back in the last couple of weeks. Urban areas are observing around four to five hours of load-shedding, while the situation is worse in rural areas.\nThe demand for electricity is around 14,500 megawatts while the system is generating around 10,000MW of electricity. The huge shortfall in generation is witnessed despite very high dependable capacity and low economic growth.\nThere is nothing special about the current demand for electricity since economic activities have slowed down. Here comes the question of reliability?\nThe system is bound to collapse during the peak of winter owing to transmission constraints. Technical description goes on to state that the outmoded equipment cannot withstand the dense fog. Fog protection devices which are made up of modern material are not available.\nThe interconnections among different components of the system are not synchronous. Transmission lines could not be connected to power plants in a timely manner.\nThe functioning of a typical sub-station is complex as it increases and decreases voltage through transformers and acts as metering for electricity generated by power plants.\nIt also contains lightening arrestors which control a spike in voltage; circuit breakers act as a safety against overloading; switch gears control and isolate the power system, etc.\nRead Unannounced gas load-shedding provokes outcry\nAll these components are neither properly maintained nor upgraded adequately. In addition, technical staff is not well-trained and lacks professionalism.\nMoving away from the technical description, we discuss the political considerations.\nThe government started structural reforms in the power sector in the early 1990s. Those reforms are still going on. Blackouts and outages are quite normal in the dollar-scarce Pakistan.\nFor instance, the scarcity of dollars doesn\u2019t allow the government to contract furnace oil in advance. Hence, the import and delivery of furnace oil would get delayed.\nIn addition, domestic gas is not abundantly available for power production. In that event, imported LNG will act as a substitute that would also require scarce dollars. Hence, electricity production will remain sub-optimal in the presence of low foreign exchange reserves along with usual outages.\nHowever, these blackouts provide opportunity for furthering reforms in the transmission system. Proponents of reforms would come down hard on the government and recommend a market-based solution.\nFor instance, they would state that transmission constraints could not be tackled by the government so there is an urgent need to bring the private sector in the transmission system.\nRead Transmission firm hopes to free Lahore of load-shedding\nThen a pre-feasibility study has commenced and a team of consultants provided a technocratic solution without taking into account the ground realities.\nUnder the Transmission Policy of 2015, the private sector has already constructed a high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission line as reported by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) in the State of Industry Report 2022.\nThis newly constructed transmission line is still underutilised owing to coordination issues. However, the government is bound to pay a certain amount to the private operator as per the purchase agreement.\nTheoretically, this transmission line is better in terms of technology and cost. Practically, this turns out to be an expensive solution given resource constraints.\nSimilarly, the current centralised system of electrical grids is also under attack. Reformers have already proposed microgrids to back up the current system in the event of a blackout as these grids may complement the conventional system.\nIn a nutshell, the power sector is in the grip of efficiency-driven reforms and the system is still not reliable. There are winners and losers attached with these reforms.\nThe lower and large strata of population are the losers while the people who are willing and able to pay are the winners.\nThese reforms have ignored the paramount public interest. Hence, the reforms would entail a huge political cost for the future government.\nThe writer has worked at SDSB, Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPublished in The Express Tribune, January 22nd, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"}, {"title": "Value chain(ed): a fresh and objective look", "url": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2453976/value-chained-a-fresh-and-objective-look", "date": "January 22, 2024", "article_text": "\n\nISLAMABAD:\n\nIt has become almost a cliche to say that we need to focus on value addition in all of the economic activities and we should become part of the regional or global value chains.\nWhile the concept has its own merits, and more importantly, the enabling factors and prerequisites, we should have a fresh and objective look at it. The value addition, or the benefits of it, should be valued and distributed effectively, comprehensively and more importantly equitably. The equitable value spread or distribution can only be achieved when the main contributor to the value chain, which is the producer of the first instance, gets the most out of it.\nThe current form of value chains actually constrains the equitable distribution of value benefits, thus chains the value. The chained value also means that the so-called value chain partners do not have time, appetite and business model to go beyond a mere supplier constrained by a certain type of activity as part of the value chain.\nLet us take the example of global value chains (GVC) in textiles. There are many of the Pakistani textile producers who are part of the one or the other GVCs.\nThe problem, however, is how much are they gaining out of this value chain contribution. For example, if one of the textile producers is producing jeans for a renowned global brand, the selling price of this producer may not be even one-tenth of the selling price of that jeans by the global brand.\nMore importantly, the Pakistani producer may be constrained, due to contract clauses, to produce the similar jeans with its own brand name. In such cases, what exactly are we getting by being part of the GVCs? It is just a small, nominal business margin that any of the businesses could gain. Beyond this monetary benefit, there are also the constraints towards indigenous value addition, development of national brands and culture of competition and quality pursuit at national level.\nOne may ask, rightfully, that who forces such producers to be part of the GVCs and why don\u2019t they develop their national or regional value chains and establish their own brands. There are some positive examples in this regard, but this space is largely unattended for long.\nRead\u00a0\u00a0Spending restraint a must for economic stability\nIt may be due to lack of entrepreneurial aptitudes, thus oblivious to such opportunities, or it may be the lack of enabling ecosystem through institutional and industry support.\nAt best, our institutional support is geared towards providing concessionary finance and logistics support for exporters, regardless of the nature, scope and economic efficiency of such exports and exporters. There is no mechanism or criteria to assess the potential non-realisation of economic potential or opportunity cost of exporting at raw or intermediary levels. It should be focused upon.\nWhile it may not be feasible to penalise the untapped economic potential, it may surely be encouraged through providing additional benefits, and taking away the support from national exchequer for such instances.\nOn the entrepreneurial side, it may not be easy to witness a paradigm shift due to longstanding societal normals, business culture and values and lack of support mechanisms, particularly the access to finance. It is surely possible and needed to incentivise it and provide with the required elements such as capital.\nEven one-tenth of the spending by funds and mechanisms such as the Export Development Fund, would suffice to bring this visible paradigm shift in developing the new and encouraging the existing entrepreneurs to come up with indigenous value chains, maximise the retention of benefits by the GVCs, and encourage the many untapped entrepreneurial talent to be materialised.\nIt is pertinent to mention that there were huge expectations from the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), in the context of establishing value chains in Pakistan. One may analyse the factors while it has not been realised thus far and what needs to be done in order to tap into this huge potential.\nIt is not necessarily bad to be part of the GVCs, however, it all depends on what you get out of it and what do you negotiate in terms of monetary, technology transfer, brand or reputation and other benefits. We, in Pakistan, are unfortunately not good in negotiations. Let the value be created, accumulated and most importantly retained, rather than the value chained.\nThe writer is an international economist\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPublished in The Express Tribune, January 22nd, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n"}, {"title": "Is it time for SBP to alleviate debt burden?", "url": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2453975/is-it-time-for-sbp-to-alleviate-debt-burden", "date": "January 22, 2024", "article_text": "\n\nKARACHI:\n\nPakistan\u2019s debt sustainability is once again a topic of discussion, resonating not just locally but also in global capital hubs. The consensus is clear: the level of loans poses a burden on citizens.\nThe ramifications of misgovernance, poor policymaking, and the myopic vision of first-class stakeholders directly impact the middle and lower classes disproportionately. In this context, coupled with a historically high 22% interest rate, the question arises: Is it time for the central bank to alleviate the debt burden on the exchequer?\nTwenty-eight years ago, in 1996, interest rates touched 20%, while Pakistan\u2019s population averages 21 years in age. Approximately 150 million people have never experienced an era with a 20% interest rate, yet they will bear the brunt of these missteps.\nThe economic manoeuvres of politicians, repeatedly tried and failed, have left the country devoid of strong purchasing power, quality education, decent job prospects, and hope for a financially comfortable old age. It\u2019s no surprise that nearly half of Pakistan\u2019s population contemplates migration in search of employment opportunities abroad.\nPakistan\u2019s total tax collection is anticipated to be around Rs9 trillion, while the cost of \u201cinterest\u201d alone is projected to be Rs8.5 trillion. The misery has two causes: the magnitude of the debt cannot be reduced overnight and requires deep structural reforms to cut expenditure and increase revenue.\nHowever, the mark-up/interest on public debt needs to be viewed with a fresh perspective. Economists are divided on whether inflation in Pakistan is a result of excessive money printing or currency depreciation-induced imported inflation.\nRead\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SBP gives Rs1.25tr to meet funding needs of banks\nThe extent to which a 22% interest rate can control inflation arising from increasing power, gas, and food prices is a separate debate. Imports are constrained to navigate through until exports grow and the economy streamlines state-owned enterprises (SOEs).\nThere is also reluctance to implement growth-inducing measures under the International Monetary Fund\u2019s standby agreement, as strict discipline is mandated to manage limited US dollar reserves.\nWithout support from China, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, Pakistan would face a much more challenging credit default scenario. Urgency at the highest forums, possibly the Special Investment Facilitation Council, is paramount to attract foreign investment in the short to medium term.\nWhile headline CPI stands at 29%, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has repeatedly highlighted that the \u201creal interest rate\u201d remains positive on a 12-month forward basis. Government borrowing costs have also reduced by nearly 4%, from the highest T-bill auction at 25% per year to a more reasonable 21%.\nRead\u00a0 SBP report keeps GDP growth projection at 2-3%\nIn terms of the balance of payments, December witnessed a current account surplus of nearly $400 million, creating room for monetary easing, given that the current account deficit is expected to stay within budgeted numbers, although Eurobond inflows are unlikely.\nSince April 2023, the Real Effective Exchange Rate has increased from 85 to 98, suggesting that the appreciation of the Pakistani rupee may need to pause to make exports more competitive and balance the books.\nWhile there are examples of economies with weaker economic structures and interest rates below 20%, such as Egypt and Nigeria, there is also a worrisome precedent of financial instability with rates at 42% in Turkey.\nThe SBP\u2019s monetary policy committee might follow the trend and cut interest rates by 1%, signalling that rates will only be cut when the situation is well under control. Alternatively, it may delay the decision until a new government is formed to receive credit for initiating monetary easing.\nWhatever the approach, borrowers need relief, and the Pakistani government is eager for an interest rate cut, but only if it aligns with strict structural reforms. Short-term growth without reform would be detrimental.\nWith a 21% policy rate, it remains relatively high; it\u2019s time to signal that the challenging days are behind us.\nTHE WRITER IS AN INDEPENDENT ECONOMIC ANALYST\n\u00a0\nPublished in The Express Tribune, January 22nd, 2024.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n"}, {"title": "Pakistan, Iran\u00a0working discreetly to prevent future border crisis\u00a0", "url": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2453974/pakistan-iran-working-discreetly-to-prevent-future-border-crisis", "date": "January 21, 2024", "article_text": "\n\nISLAMABAD:\n\nPakistan and Iran have been quietly working to evolve a new mechanism preventing the recurrence of events of the last week that for a moment jeopardise their longstanding relationship.\u00a0\nOfficial sources told The Express Tribune on Sunday that the two countries might have agreed to de-escalate tensions but were aware of the rupture the tit-for-tat missile attacks caused to the bilateral ties.\u00a0\nPakistan is busy assessing the situation and trying to find answers as to what prompted Iran to conduct missile strikes. One source said that the two countries were pulled from the brink, but it would take some time before the bilateral ties were put on track.\u00a0\nThe key concern is how the crisis would shape the future ties between the two countries. \u00a0\nIt would be an understatement to say that the Iranian missile strikes put the bilateral ties at stake, the source added.\u00a0\nRead more:\u00a0Jilani speaks to Iranian counterpart to defuse tensions\nAccording to sources, Pakistan is carefully analysing the situation to understand the long-term implications of the crisis that was dealt with quickly as far as de-escalation was concerned.\u00a0\nPakistan and Iran may often boast about the \"friendly and brotherly\" relations but underneath does exist certain issues that cause suspicion in both the capitals.\u00a0\nAt the heart of the problem are the concerns both sides often expressed privately about the use of each other\u2019s soil by certain terrorist groups.\u00a0\nPakistan has longstanding concerns that Baloch terrorist outfits find refuge across the border in the Sistan-Balochistan province of Iran. Tehran on the other hand pointed a finger at anti-Iran militant groups such as Jaish al-Adl having hideouts in Balochistan province in Pakistan. Iran gave the same justification for carrying out cross-border missile strikes under the pretext that it was aimed at Jaish al-Adl hideouts.\u00a0\nRead more:\u00a0De-escalation imminent as friends engage in hectic diplomacy\nPakistan, in retaliation, conducted strikes and pounded with bombs what it said were the sanctuaries of Baloch terrorists. Iran admitted that those killed in Pakistani strikes were not Iranians.\u00a0\nThe problem of these militant groups existed for many years and has been the cause of friction between the two neighbours, though Iran and Pakistan tried to downplay the crisis in the past.\u00a0\nIn order to avoid any hiccup, the two countries in recent years undertook several measures including fencing the border, better coordination between the two border security forces and frequent high-level exchanges.\u00a0\nThat was the reason Pakistan was baffled by the fact that Iran opted for missile strikes despite having existing bilateral mechanisms to discuss and resolve such issues.\u00a0\nHowever, the Iranian strikes made those bilateral arrangements irrelevant for the time being.\u00a0\nIn the aftermath of the tit-for-tat attacks, Pakistan is keen to work with Iran on a new arrangement that prevents such incidents in the future. One proposal is to strengthen the existing mechanisms to enhance cooperation in the fight against terrorism. Instead of violating each other\u2019s sovereignty, the two countries may deepen intelligence cooperation, according to sources.\u00a0\nThese proposals would be discussed during the engagements between the two countries. Foreign ministers of Iran and Pakistan spoke twice since the tit-for-tat attacks and agreed to work closely to deal with the matter.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt is expected the two foreign ministers may take reciprocal visits to each other\u2019s countries to discuss the way forward.\u00a0\nPakistan, on its part, has no intention to escalate tensions. The National Security Committee (NSC) in its meeting on Friday carefully used language to send a message of conciliation and cooperation.\u00a0\nThe high-powered civil military forum termed the tit-for-tat attacks as \"minor irritants.\" This, according to sources, was done purposely to avoid any further escalation.\u00a0\nIran too, after Pakistan's retaliatory strikes, toned down its rhetoric. Tehran stressed that it was adhering to the policy of friendly ties with Islamabad and that no external enemies could strain their cooperation.\u00a0\n"}, {"title": "PTI NA-119 candidate withdraws in Maryam\u2019s favour\u00a0", "url": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2453973/pti-na-119-candidate-withdraws-in-maryams-favour", "date": "January 21, 2024", "article_text": "\nIn a significant political development ahead of general elections, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) candidate Mehr Muhammad Waseem on Sunday declared his withdrawal in favour of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Senior Vice President Maryam Nawaz in Lahore's NA-119, Express News reported.\u00a0\nWaseem\u00a0along with numerous PTI members also defected to PML-N, pledging their allegiance to Maryam Nawaz.

It doesn\u2019t want to see the situation out of control\u201d she said.\nLisa Curtis is a senior fellow and director of the Indo-Pacific Security Program at CNAS. She is a foreign policy and national security expert with over 20 years of service in the US government, including at the National Security Council (NSC), CIA, State Department, and Capitol Hill.\n\u201cSo, I think Iran needed to show that it will strike back when attacked and Pakistan, in some ways, is viewed as an easier target, allowing Iran to show its people a retaliatory response to the terrorist attack without provoking Israel or the US,\u201d the senior fellow Indo-Pacific security program said.\n\u201cPak-India tension is always high, there is also a tension between Pakistan and Taliban because they are avoiding cracking down Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP) terrorist.\u201d She warned of escalating chaos in a volatile region, and that is the main concern of the US.\nShe stated that Pakistan and Iran must alleviate tensions, highlighting their apparent progress in that direction. Pakistan has been stressing on brotherly relations, and Iran has been distinguishing between Pakistani people and officials from terrorists.\nShe believed these actions indicate their collaborative efforts to de-escalate the current tense situation. In response to a question about the timing chosen by Iran for intrusion in Pakistan, Lisa stated that it was intended to send an international signal. According to her, Iran aimed to showcase strength and resilience, reassuring the world that it remains formidable and ready to confront any aggression.\nRead more: Pakistan-Iran border remains open: official\n\u201cDespite the recent terrorist attack, Iran sought to project strength, and unfortunately Pakistan happened to be one of the targets,\u201d she added.\nBaloch separatists\nThe director of the Indo-Pacific Security Program acknowledged the gestures of de-escalation by Pakistan and Iran, noting that the region is presently not at immediate risk of further escalation. Nevertheless, she expressed apprehension regarding potential risks in the future.\n\u201cBaloch separatists in Iran that have been attacked could retaliate inside Pakistan and so what will happen then? Pakistan suspecting Indian involvement with Baloch separatists, may feel the need to send signals to India\u201d Lisa raised crucial questions.\nContrary to prevailing views, Lisa underscored the current problems being faced by Pakistan never allows it to entangle in any regional conflict. The senior expert also highlighted other key issues confronting Pakistan including economic downturn, dependence on an IMF package, terrorist attacks, and the upcoming general elections which come against the backdrop of a diminished reputation for the establishment, given its perceived actions against the most popular political party, Pakistan Tehreek-Insaf (PTI), and the incarceration of its founding chairman Imran Khan.\nResponding to a question regarding the future of Baloch terrorists, she underscored the counterproductive nature of resorting to terrorism. She emphasised that engaging in terrorist activities will worsen the lives of Baloch individuals on either side.\n\u201cWhen it becomes violent insurgencies, this is not going to help them any way, shape or form to gain any additional rights or economic benefits.\u201d Discussing China's role in the current situation, the senior expert observed that Chinese officials might believe they should be able to influence the situation. She asserted that when it comes down to it, they truly don't have the ability to influence regional developments as much as they might hope.\n\u201cChina only has so much influence and power in this kind of volatile situation, it enjoys strong and traditionally close relations with Pakistan, as well as endeavours to maintain positive ties with Iran, but its influence has limits\u201d she asserted.\nShe emphasised that even with the strength of the China-Pakistan relationship, it's crucial to recognize the limitations of Chinese mediation. In her view, the effectiveness of Chinese involvement may not meet the expectations, particularly in complex and unstable situations.\nSharing her observation regarding upcoming polls in Pakistan, she noted that there was malaise about the political situation and the elections and not much enthusiasm for the polls. \u201cThere is a perception among the people of Pakistan establishment [seen as the centre of power] has picked the party of choice and the popular one PTI doesn\u2019t stand much of a chance, subsequently unfortunately there is lack of faith in country\u2019s democratic process\u201d Lisa raised concern.\nTaliban, TTP\nShe highlighted the turndown economic situation of Pakistan and high inflation which makes thing more difficult. She believes there is general kind of malaise in country. Regarding the security she pointed out that TTP terrorists are also become headache for Pakistan\u2019s security institutions.\n\u201cThere is a deep frustration among the Pakistan security establishment about their lack of ability to influence the Taliban to crack down on TTP terrorists on its territory,\u201d she claimed. The director of the Indo-Pacific Security Program believes that the independent stance adopted by the Taliban, where they do not feel the need to answer to Pakistan or fulfil Pakistan's requests, is a new and surprising development for the Pakistani establishment.\n\u201cA new situation is emerging in the region, and Pakistan is navigating its stance in light of a newly confident Taliban that now has options beyond the Pakistan military establishment,\" she added.\nThe senior security expert is dissatisfied with the security situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) and Balochistan, attributing one of the reasons to the rise of the Taliban.\nShe further pointed out the shared ideological attraction between the Taliban and various other terrorist groups, highlighting that this alignment in ideological principles allows these groups to operate more freely in Afghanistan as the Taliban's control provides them with a relatively secure environment.\n\u201cThe lack of pressure on terrorist groups, owing to the Taliban\u2019s control in Afghanistan is having a counterproductive effect, so that is backfiring into Pakistan and there is more insecurity there's more Taliban type of influence happening in the region and so it is impacting the elections, economy and women and girls,\u201d Lisa Curtis raised concern.\nShe added that the oppression of women and girls under the Taliban regime in Afghanistan is indeed having a profound effect within Pakistan. Women and girls in Pakistan are also suffering due to this regressive fundamentalist ideology that the Taliban is introducing to the region.\nAlso read: Iranian stunt\n\u00a0\n"}, {"title": "Buner celebrates Ellum winter festival", "url": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2453953/buner-celebrates-ellum-winter-festival", "date": "January 21, 2024", "article_text": "\n\nBUNER:\n\nThe Ellum Winter Festival, a two-day extravaganza, concluded after\u00a0Corps Commander Peshawar Lieutenant General Hassan Azhar Hayat presided over the closing ceremony, a statement said on Sunday\nIGFC North Major General Noor Wali Khan, district administration, security forces officials and a diverse array of guests joined in the festivities.\nThe festival saw 110 bikes and 60 jeeps from across Pakistan converge in Buner, marking the first-ever winter festival in the area.

Caretaker Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar has given the commitments to the IMF.\nThe report also disclosed that the caretaker government had missed the primary budget surplus target of the first quarter of the fiscal year.

The captive power users having no access to grid would be given one year for the transition to the electricity grid, at which point the prices will be increased to the RLNG-equivalent, according to the assurance to the IMF.\nThe finance minister further assured the IMF that in order to bring the use of captive power generation to a conclusive end by Jan 2025, the government would announce a plan to make the use of this generation uneconomic by March-end 2024.\nPossibility of a mini-budget\nPakistan has committed with the IMF that it stands ready to take revenue measures equal to Rs18 billion per month provided the revenue collection of the FBR falls short of the monthly targets.

To neutralise the impact of creative accounting, the IMF adjusted the primary surplus target from Rs87 billion to Rs389 billion, which the government could not meet, showed the report.\nThe IMF board gave a waiver for missing the primary surplus target, which remained at Rs376 billion, according to the report.\nThe caretaker government has also clarified its position on creative accounting in these words. \u201cThe general government primary surplus in FY24Q1 was 0.4% of GDP, in line with initial expectations. That said, part of this additional primary surplus was due to technical delays in releasing power subsidies of Rs72 billion, which were registered in early October.
